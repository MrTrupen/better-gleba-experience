# Better Gleba Experience

I spend 12h in a row on ~~the living hell~~ Gleba yesterday and it got me thinking how early game on this planet can be improved.

There is my proof of concept solution: **basic biochamber** which is worse than normal one, but **doesn't consume nutrients!**
It's something like basic oil processing and advanced oil processing, start simple and improve later.

## Normal Biochamber vs Basic Biochamber

- Modules slots: 4 -> 0
- Productivity bonus: 50% -> 25%
- Crafting speed: 2x -> 0.5x
- Power usage: nutrients -> electricity (50kW)
- Beacons: affected by beacons -> not affected
- Pollution: reduce pollution (-1) -> produce pollution (1); produce spores (0.25)

## Installation

Download and install from the [official Factorio mod
portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/better-gleba-experience).

## Features

Simplifies early game on gleba by introducing worse biochamber which do not require nutrients to run
